 'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd:
 'It came to pass, as most like it was — '
 'One fair daughter, and no more,
 'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
 A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; — 
 A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
 A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;
 A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
 A very, very — pajock.
 A whole one, I.
 About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
 Alack, and fie for shame!
 All flaxen was his poll:
 All in the morning bedtime,
 An thou hadst not come to my bed.
 And I a maid at your window,
 And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
 And dupp'd the chamber door,
 And hath shipp'd me intil the land,
 And his sandal shoon.
 And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
 And on his grave rain'd many a tear. —
 And passion in the gods.
 And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
 And we cast away moan:
 And will he not come again?
 And will he not come again?
 And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
 Anon he finds him,
 As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
 As if I had never been such.
 As low as to the fiends!
 At his head a grass green turf,
 At his heels a stone.
 Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
 Black as his purpose,did the night resemble
 Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
 But age, with his stealing steps,
 But as we often see, against some storm,
 But if the gods themselves did see her then,
 But never doubt I love.
 But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen, —
 But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
 By Gis and by Saint Charity,
 By cock, they are to blame.
 By his cockle bat and' staff
 Did nothing.
 Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
 Doubt that the sun doth move;
 Doubt truth to be a liar;
 For and a shrouding sheet;
 For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy, —
 For if the king like not the comedy,
 For some must watch, while some must sleep:
 For such a guest is meet.
 For such a guest is meet.
 For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
 For us, and for our tragedy,
 From another one?
 Go to thy death-bed,
 God ha' mercy on his soul!
 HAMLET.'
 Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
 Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
 He is dead and gone, lady,
 He is dead and gone;
 He is gone, he is gone,
 He never will come again.
 Here stooping to your clemency,
 Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny
 How should I your true love know
 Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
 In general synod, take away her power;
 In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
 Larded all with sweet flowers;
 Let in the maid, that out a maid
 Methought it was very sweet;
 Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
 Never departed more.
 No, no, he is dead,
 Now falls on Priam. — 
 Now is be total gules; horridly trick'd
 O, a pit of clay for to be made
 O, a pit of clay for to be made
 O, methought there was nothing meet.
 O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
 Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
 Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
 Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
 On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
 Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
 Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
 Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
 Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
 Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
 Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
 Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!
 So runs the world away. — 
 So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
 So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;
 Stoops to his base; and with a hideous crash
 Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,
 Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,
 That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
 The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
 The hart ungalled play;
 The instant burst of clamour that she made, — 
 The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
 The which he loved passing well.'
 They bore him barefac'd on the bier
 This realm dismantled was
 To be your Valentine.
 To contract, O, the time for, ah, my behove,
 To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,
 To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day
 Unless things mortal move them not at all, — 
 We beg your hearing patiently.
 When he lay couched in the ominous horse, — 
 When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
 Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
 Which bewept to the grave did go
 Which was declining on the milky head
 White his shroud as the mountain snow,
 Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
 Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
 Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
 With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
 With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
 With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
 With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
 With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
 With true-love showers.
 Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
 You promis'd me to wed.
 Young men will do't if they come to't;
'And in part him; — but,' you may say, 'not well:
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman' — 
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,' — 
'In her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c.'
'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere;
'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.' — Come, begin: — 
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to

A Norman.
A Priest.
A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
A bloody deed! — almost as bad, good mother,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A brother's murder! — Pray can I not,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
A churchyard.
A combination and a form, indeed,
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A document in madness, — thoughts and remembrance fitted.
A double blessing is a double grace;
A dream itself is but a shadow.
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
A face without a heart?
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
A hall in the Castle.
A hall in the Castle.
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient;
A hit, a very palpable hit.
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A king of shreds and patches! —
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A little month; or ere those shoes were old
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
A ministering angel shall my sister be
A more remote part of the Castle.
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
A murderer and a villain;
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of
A piece of him.
A plain in Denmark.
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow;
A room in Polonius's house.
A room in Polonius's house.
A room in the Castle.
A room in the Castle.
A room in the Castle.
A room in the Castle.
A sable silver'd.
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A scullion!
A second time I kill my husband dead
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
A sister driven into desperate terms, — 
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A station like the herald Mercury
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
A thing, my lord!
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
A very noble youth: mark.
A very riband in the cap of youth,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A whoreson, mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
A worthy pioner! — Once more remove, good friends.
ACT I

ACT V
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
According to the phrase or the addition
Acts little of his will. — Tell me, Laertes,
Addicted so and so;' and there put on him
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Affront Ophelia:
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
After the thing it loves.
Against some part of Poland.
Against the which, a moiety competent
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven,
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
Ah me, what act,
Ah, ha! — Come, some music! Come, the recorders! — 
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
Alack,
Alack, what noise is this?
Alas, alas!
Alas, he's mad!
Alas, how is't with you,
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
Alas, look here, my lord!
Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
Alas, poor ghost!
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
Alas, then she is drown'd?
Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
All given to mine ear.
All may be well.
All my smooth body.
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
All.
All.
All.
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
Among a mineral of metals base,
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
An earnest conjuration from the king, — 
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
An understanding simple and unschool'd;
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
And I am sick at heart.
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant:
And I beseech you instantly to visit
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
And I do think, — or else this brain of mine
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
And I with them the third night kept the watch:
And I'll be plac'd, so please you, in the ear
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched
And a man's life is no more than to say One.
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
And all we wail for.
And am most sensibly in grief for it,
And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so:
And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
And bear it to the chapel.
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And break your own neck down.
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
And by opposing end them? — To die, — to sleep, — 
And call it accident.
And call the noblest to the audience.
And can say nothing; no, not for a king
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
And carriage of the article design'd,
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
And could of men distinguish, her election
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
And do such bitter business as the day
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
And draw you into madness? think of it:
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
And each particular hair to stand on end
And either curb the devil, or throw him out
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
And even the like precurse of fierce events, — 
And ever three parts coward, — I do not know
And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
And for his death no wind shall breathe;
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
And for the day confin'd to wastein fires,
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
And for your rapier most especially,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
And gave you such a masterly report
And gem of all the nation.
And hath abatements and delays as many
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
And he to England shall along with you:
And he, repulsed, — a short tale to make, — 
And hears it roar beneath.
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
And hit the woundless air. — O, come away!
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend:
And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
And hurt my brother.
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
And in part hi;m; — do you mark this, Reynaldo?
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
And in the porches of my ears did pour
And in this brainish apprehension, kills
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
And leads the will to desperate undertakings,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
And let him know so.
And let him ply his music.
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
And let me wring your heart: for so I shall,
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
And let them know both what we mean to do
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And let us once again assail your ears,
And liegemen to the Dane.
And live the purer with the other half.
And lose the name of action. — Soft you now!
And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
And makes each petty artery in this body
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
And many such-like as's of great charge, — 
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
And meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
And more above, hath his solicitings,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here, — 
And my imaginations are as foul
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
And never come mischance between us twain!
And not have strew'd thy grave.
And not where I had aim'd them.
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
And now I'll do't; — and so he goes to heaven;
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. — God b' wi' ye.
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
And our affairs from England come too late:
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And pious action we do sugar o'er
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
And prais'd be rashness for it, — let us know,
And prey on garbage.
And prologue to the omen coming on, — 
And put it in his pocket!
And reason panders will.
And recks not his own read.
And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
And set a double varnish on the fame
And sets a blister there; makes marriage-vows
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! — Hold, my heart;
And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,
And smelt so? Pah!
And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
And so am I reveng'd. — that would be scann'd:
And so have I a noble father lost;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
And stand a comma 'tween their amities;
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
And sure I am two men there are not living
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
And tell you what I know.
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And that I see, in passages of proof,
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
And that in way of caution, — I must tell you
And that our drift look through our bad performance.
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine, —
And the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
And the queen too, and that presently.
And then it started, like a guilty thing
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
And then, sir, does he this, — he does — What was I about to say? — 
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;
And there I see such black and grained spots
And there assume some other horrible form
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
And these few precepts in thy memory
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
And they in France of the best rank and station
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
And thrice his head thus waving up and down, — 
And thus a while the fit will work on him;
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
And thus the native hue of resolution
And thy best graces spend it at thy will! — 
And thy commandment all alone shall live
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
And to the last bended their light on me.
And to the manner born, — it is a custom
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
And vanish'd from our sight.
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
And we beseech you bend you to remain
And we did think it writ down in our duty
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? — 
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
And what's in prayer but this twofold force, — 
And what's untimely done: so haply slander, — 
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
And when you are desirous to be bles'd,
And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And will not let belief take hold of him
And will not wrong it.
And will this brother's wager frankly play. — 
And with a larger tether may he walk
And with a look so piteous in purport
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
And with no less nobility of love
And with such cozenage — is't not perfect conscience
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
And you are stay'd for. There, — my blessing with thee!
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught, — 
And, after, we will both our judgments join
And, as I think, they have already order
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
And, as the world were now but to begin,
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
And, like a man to double business bound,
And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd
And, — would it were not so! — you are my mother.
Angels and ministers of grace defend us! — 
Anon, as patient as the female dove,

Answer, and think upon this business.
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
Appears before them and with solemn march
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
Are joyfully return'd.
Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
Are most select and generous chief in that.
Are you fair?
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
Arm'd, my lord.
Arm'd, say you?
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay:
As 'Well, well, we know'; or 'We could, an if we would'; — 
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,
As England was his faithful tributary;
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
As I do thee. — Something too much of this. — 
As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
As are companions noted and most known
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
As day does to your eye.
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this, ha?
As did that one; and that, in my regard,
As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
As fits a king's remembrance.
As from the body of contraction plucks
As gaming, my lord.
As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
As harbingers preceding still the fates,
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve. —
As he in his particular act and place
As he is very potent with such spirits, — 
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
As how should it be so? how otherwise? — 
As if he had been loosed out of hell
As if increase of appetite had grown
As if it some impartment did desire
As in their birth, — wherein they are not guilty,
As infinite as man may undergo, — 
As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
As it doth well appear unto our state, — 
As it hath us'd to do, — that I have found
As it is common for the younger sort
As kill a king and marry with his brother.
As kill a king!
As level as the cannon to his blank,
As love between them like the palm might flourish;
As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,
As make your bouts more violent to that end, — 
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
As of a father: for let the world take note
As of a man faithful and honourable.
As oft as any passion under heaven
As one incapable of her own distress,
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
As the indifferent children of the earth.
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
As therein are set down.
As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
As thou art to thyself:
As thou'rt a man,
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
As to expend your time with us awhile,
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
As to peace-parted souls.
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
As we have warranties: her death was doubtful;
As will not leave their tinct.
As woman's love.
As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
As, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
At gaming, swearing; or about some act
At home, my lord.
At last, — a little shaking of mine arm,
At least, I am sure, it may be so in Denmark:
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
At supper! where?
At supper.
At — closes in the consequence' — ay, marry!
Attendants.
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
Away! for everything is seal'd and done
Away, I do beseech you, both away
Ay, Hamlet.
Ay, amen!
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
Ay, good my lord.
Ay, lady, 'twas my word. — 
Ay, madam, it is common.
Ay, marry, is't — crowner's quest law.
Ay, marry, is't;
Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
Ay, my good lord.
Ay, my lord,
Ay, my lord, And of calf-skins too.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord;
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you ashamed to
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Ay, sir, but 'While the grass grows' — the proverb is something
Ay, sir, what of him?
Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,
Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
Ay, very well, my lord.
Be all my sins remember'd.
Be as ourself in Denmark. — Madam, come;
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
Be rul'd; you shall not go.
Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
Be something scanter of your maiden presence;
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Been struck so to the soul that presently
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Before You visit him, to make inquiry
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
Before my God, I might not this believe
Before my daughter told me, — what might you,
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you:
Behind the arras I'll convey myself
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, — 
Being thus benetted round with villanies, — 
Believe me, I cannot.
Believe so much in him, that he is young;
Believe what?
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

Between the pass and fell incensed points
Between who?
Bid the players make haste.
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Both countenance and excuse. — Ho, Guildenstern!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
Both to my God and to my gracious king:
Both your majesties
Both.
Both.
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart, with strings of steel,
Break not your sleeps for that: — you must not think
Break we our watch up: and by my advice,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
Brief let me be. — Sleeping within my orchard,
Bring him before us.
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye! — 
But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
But I do prophesy the election lights
But I have that within which passeth show;
But I will delve one yard below their mines
But answer made it none: yet once methought

But break my heart, — for I must hold my tongue!
But come; — 
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
But do not go with it!
But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
But farewell it, for I will use no art.

But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
But he's an arrant knave.
But how hath she
But if you hold it fit, after the play,
But if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
But in battalions! First, her father slain:
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
But is this law?
But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
But keep a farm and carters.
But let it be. — Horatio, I am dead;
But let me hear from you.
But let that go.
But let this same be presently perform'd,
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
But mere implorators of unholy suits,

But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:

But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
But since he's better'd, we have therefore odds.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
But soft! but soft! aside! — Here comes the king.
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;

By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
By indirections find directions out:
By laboursome petition; and at last
By letters conjuring to that effect,
By the mass, I was about to say something: — Where did I leave?
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
By this encompassment and drift of question,
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month, — 
By-and-by is easily said.
Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
Calmly, good Laertes.
Came this from Hamlet to her?
Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder! — 
Can you advise me?

Collected from all simples that have virtue

Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
Come on! — you hear this fellow in the cellarage, — 
Come on, sir.
Come short of what he did.
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
Come, I will give you way for these your letters;
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;

Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,

Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
Could not so mope.
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,

Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot

Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet, — 
Dead for a ducat, dead!
Dead.
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! — 
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
Denmark's a prison.
Denmark? — What, my young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your
Depriv'd thee of! — Hold off the earth awhile,
Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair:
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, — to sleep; — 
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands,
Did he receive you well?
Did not together pluck such envy from him
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
Did you assay him
Did you not speak to it?
Dies in his own too much: that we would do,
Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw
Directly seasons him his enemy.
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, — 
Do not believe it.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Do not forget. This visitation
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Do not, my lord.
Do the boys carry it away?
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
Do you doubt that?
Do you know me, my lord?
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
Do you see nothing there?
Do you see this, O God?
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
Do you think 'tis this?
Do you think I meant country matters?
Do, if it will not stand.
Does by their own insinuation grow:
Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon, — 
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murder of
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?
Doth all the noble substance often doubt
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat

Dread my lord,
Drink off this potion. — Is thy union here?
Drown'd! O, where?
Drown'd, drown'd.
E'en so, my lord.

Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss:
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste

Excitements of my reason and my blood,

Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,

Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;
Fear me not: — withdraw; I hear him coming.
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
Fell into a sadness; then into a fast;
Fie on't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
Fie upon't! foh! — About, my brain! I have heard
Finger'd their packet; and, in fine, withdrew
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
Folded the writ up in the form of the other;
Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
Follow him, friends. we'll hear a play to-morrow.
Follow my mother.
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
For 'tis the sport to have the enginer

For God's love let me hear.
For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
For Hecuba?
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face;
For art and exercise in your defence,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
For by the image of my cause I see
For every man hath business and desire,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
For he himself is subject to his birth:
For he was likely, had he been put on,
For her perfections: — but my revenge will come.
For husband shalt thou, —
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god-kissing
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
For in the fatness of these pursy times
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
For love of God, forbear him!
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
For no man, sir.
For none neither.
For out o' doors he went without their help,
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him, — 
For that which thou hast done, — must send thee hence
For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
For the demand of our neglected tribute:
For the supply and profit of our hope,
For they are actions that a man might play;
For this effect defective comes by cause:
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,

Friends to this ground.
From Hamlet! Who brought them?
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
From me, whose love was of that dignity
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
From top to toe?

Give me some light: — away!
Give me the cup; let go; by heaven, I'll have't. —

Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
Give us the foils; come on.

Go seek him there. [To some Attendants.]

Go to their graves like beds; fight for a plot

Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
Hamlet the Dane.
Hamlet! Hamlet!
Hamlet, Son to the former, and Nephew to the present King.
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety, — 
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Haply the seas, and countries different,
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
Happy in that we are not over-happy;
Hark you, Guildenstern; — and you too; — at each ear a hearer: that
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and bles'd are those
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
Hath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been
Hath there been such a time, — I'd fain know that — 
Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,
Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
Have after. — To what issue will this come?
Have at you now!
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous;
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, — 
Have you forgot me?
Have you had quiet guard?
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
Have you so slander any moment leisure
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
He closes with you in this consequence;
He closes with you thus: — 'I know the gentleman;
He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he, — and
He does confess he feels himself distracted,
He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else
He falls to such perusal of my face
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
He is justly serv'd;
He likewise gives a frock or livery
He made confession of you;
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He may not, as unvalu'd persons do,
He never gave commandment for their death.
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago:
He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
He tells me, my sweet queen, he hath found
He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
He that plays the king shall be welcome, — his majesty shall
He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
He was a man, take him for all in all,
He was the first that ever bore arms.
He waxes desperate with imagination.
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
He will stay till you come.
He's fat, and scant of breath. — 
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps: — say on; come
He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
He.
Hear you, sir;
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. — 
Heaven will direct it.
Heavens make our presence and our practices
Help, help, ho!
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Her father and myself, — lawful espials, — 
Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
Her mood will needs be pitied.
Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Here in the lobby.
Here is your husband, like a milldew'd ear
Here was a gentleman of Normandy, — 
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
Here's to thy health. —
Here's yet some liquor left.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. — 
High on a stage be placed to the view;
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
His access to me.
His beard was as white as snow,
His beard was grizzled, — no?
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!
His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
His liberty is full of threats to all;
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
His means of death, his obscure burial, — 
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
His silence will sit drooping.
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood:
Hold off your hands.
Hold you the watch to-night?
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
Holla! Bernardo!
Honest, my lord!

Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Horatio, Friend to Hamlet.
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
Horatio, — or I do forget myself.
Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he
How I am punish'd with sore distraction.
How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
How all occasions do inform against me
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
How came he mad?
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself
How chances it they travel? their residence, both in
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
How do you, pretty lady?
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
How does the Queen?
How does your honour for this many a day?
How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that
How fares my lord?
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
How if I answer no?
How in my words somever she be shent,
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
How is it with you, lady?
How is't, Laertes?
How is't, my noble lord?
How long hath she been thus?
How long is that since?
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
How may we try it further?
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
How now! What news?
How now! What noise is that?
How now! what hath befall'n?
How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale:
How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
How now, Ophelia?
How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?
How now, sweet queen!
How now? a rat? [Draws.]
How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
How say you by that? — [Aside.] Still harping on my daughter: — yet
How say you then; would heart of man once think it? — 
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself, — 
How strangely?
How these things came about: so shall you hear
How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
How was this seal'd?
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure

I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I
I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure:
I am dead, Horatio. — Wretched queen, adieu! — 
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
I am glad to see you well:
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane. — 
I am satisfied in nature,
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I am tame, sir: — pronounce.
I am thy father's spirit;
I am very glad to see you. — Good even, sir. — 
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
I be so able as now.
I beseech you, remember, — 
I beseech you.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
I can no more: — the king, the king's to blame.
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
I chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
I commend my duty to your lordship.
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
I could not but by her. The other motive,
I dare damnation: — to this point I stand, — 
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' the Capitol; Brutus
I did repel his letters and denied
I did very well note him.
I do believe you think what now you speak;
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
I do beseech you.
I do not fear it; I have seen you both;
I do not know from what part of the world
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
I do not think so; since he went into France I have been in
I do not think't.
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
I doubt it is no other but the main, — 
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
I embrace it freely;
I find thee apt;
I ha't:
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
I have a daughter, — have whilst she is mine, — 
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
I have a voice and precedent of peace
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God hath
I have in quick determination
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not
I have seen nothing.
I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
I have sworn't.
I have, my lord.
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
I heard thee speak me a speech once, — but it was never acted;
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot
I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
I know, no touch of it, my lord.
I know, you are not ignorant, —
I like him not; nor stands it safe with us
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well;
I lov'd Ophelia; forty thousand brothers
I lov'd you ever: but it is no matter;
I lov'd your father, and we love ourself;
I made to her in marriage; and to decline
I mean, my head upon your lap?
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
I must to England; you know that?
I never gave you aught.
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
I pr'ythee, take thy fingers from my throat;
I pr'ythee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,
I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him. —
I pray you go with me.
I pray you pass with your best violence:
I pray you, give me leave.
I pray you, now receive them.
I pray you.
I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
I say, away! — Go on; I'll follow thee.
I see a cherub that sees them. — But, come; for England! — 
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
I shall not look upon his like again.
I shall obey you: — 
I shall obey, my lord.
I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
I shall, my lord.
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
I should have fatted all the region kites
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
I stay too long: — but here my father comes.
I tell thee she is; and therefore make her grave straight: the
I thank you: — keep the door. — O thou vile king,
I thank your lordship, t'is very hot.
I think I hear them. — Stand, ho! Who is there?
I think it be no other but e'en so:
I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
I think it lacks of twelve.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
I think nothing, my lord.
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
I understand you not, my lord.
I warr'nt it will.
I warrant your honour.
I was the more deceived.
I will be brief: — your noble son is mad:
I will bestow him, and will answer well
I will do't, my lord.
I will do't:
I will not speak with her.
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. — You
I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your
I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well:
I will say so.
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your
I will watch to-night;
I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
I will, my lord.
I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
I will.
I would I had been there.
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
I would know that.
I would not hear your enemy say so;
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
I'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance
I'll blessing beg of you. — For this same lord
I'll board him presently: — O, give me leave.
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
I'll cross it, though it blast me. — Stay, illusion!
I'll do't. — Dost thou come here to whine?
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. — 
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. — 
I'll rant as well as thou.
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I'll visit you.
I'll warrant you:
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
If by direct or by collateral hand

In censure of his seeming.
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole, — 
In faith,
In filial obligation, for some term
In further evil?
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
In happy time.
In heaven: send thither to see: if your messenger find him not
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
In honourable fashion.
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
In neither aught, or in extremity.
In noise so rude against me?
In obstinate condolement is a course
In second husband let me be accurst!
In that and all things will we show our duty.
In the corrupted currents of this world
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
In what particular thought to work I know not;
In what, my dear lord?
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
In youth when I did love, did love,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Indeed, that is out o' the air. [Aside.] How pregnant sometimes
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Indeed? I heard it not: then draws near the season
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
Into a towering passion.
Into my grave?
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err;
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
Is by a forged process of my death
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Is it a custom?
Is it not like the King?
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Is not to stir without great argument,
Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
Is strict in his arrest, — O, I could tell you, — 
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Is the main motive of our preparations,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
Is thought-sick at the act.
Is very cunning in.
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't,
Is't possible?
Is't possible?
Is, in his retirement, marvellous distempered.
It beckons you to go away with it,
It could not move thus.
It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
It falls right.
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
It had been so with us, had we been there:
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, — 
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me:'
It is a damned ghost that we have seen;
It is a nipping and an eager air.
It is a poison temper'd by himself. — 
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
It is backed like a weasel.
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
It is most retrograde to our desire:
It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark, and
It is not, nor it cannot come to good;
It is offended.
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
It lifted up it head, and did address
It likes us well;
It may be death.
It may be, very likely.
It might, my lord.
It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
It must be shortly known to him from England
It seems it as proper to our age
It sends some precious instance of itself
It shall as level to your judgment pierce
It shall be so:
It shall do well: but yet do I believe
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. — Pr'ythee say on. — 
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven;
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
It warms the very sickness in my heart
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. — Be
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
It was against your highness; whereat griev'd, — 
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
It waves me forth again; — I'll follow it.
It waves me still. — 
It waves you to a more removed ground:
It well appears: — but tell me
It will be laid to us, whose providence
It will be short: the interim is mine;
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
It will not speak; then will I follow it.
It would be spoke to.
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
It would have much amaz'd you.
Itself to motion, like as it would speak:

Laertes before you fall to play.
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
Laertes, Son to Polonius.
Laertes, and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &amp;c.]
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Laertes, you shall hear them.
Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
Last night of all,
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Lay her i' the earth; — 
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
Leave us.
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
Led by a delicate and tender prince;
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Lest with this piteous action you convert
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
Let four captains
Let her come in.
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing, but not
Let him bless thee too.
Let him demand his fill.
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
Let me be no assistant for a state,
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Let me not think on't, — Frailty, thy name is woman! — 
Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! — I knew him,
Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
Let them come in.
Let this be so;
Let us haste to hear it,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Let's follow, Gertrude;
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
Let's further think of this;
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
Lights, lights, lights!
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
Like Niobe, all tears; — why she, even she, — 
Like a good child and a true gentleman.
Like quills upon the fretful porcupine:
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
Like to a murdering piece, in many places
Like wonder-wounded hearers? this is I,
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself, — 
Long live the king!
Longer, longer.
Look here upon this picture, and on this, — 
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Look to the queen there, ho!
Look to't, I charge you; come your ways.
Look with what courteous action
Look you, I'll go pray.
Look, my lord, it comes!
Look, where he goes, even now out at the portal!
Look, whether he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
Looking before and after, gave us not
Looks it not like the King? mark it, Horatio.
Lord Hamlet, — with his doublet all unbrac'd;
Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at

Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
Love! his affections do not that way tend;

Mad call I it; for to define true madness,
Mad for thy love?
Mad let us grant him then: and now remains
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
Madam, I wish it may.
Madam, how like you this play?
Madam, it so fell out that certain players
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
Make mad the guilty, and appal the free;
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;
Make up my sum. — What wilt thou do for her?
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
Makes mouths at the invisible event;
Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations:
Makes vow before his uncle never more
Making night hideous, and we fools of nature

Mass, I cannot tell.
May be the devil: and the devil hath power
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
May give his saying deed; which is no further

May sweep to my revenge.
May violets spring! — I tell thee, churlish priest,
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:

Mine uncle!
Mine, sir.
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
More matter, with less art.
More relative than this. — the play's the thing
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
More than in words?
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
Most constantly.
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Most free in his reply.
Most generous, and free from all contriving,
Most holy and religious fear it is
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
Most like a gentleman.
Most like: — it harrows me with fear and wonder.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
Most throughly for my father.
Most welcome home!
Mother, good-night. — Indeed, this counsellor
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Much heat and him. I'll silence me e'en here.
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
Murder!
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
Must give us pause: there's the respect
Must render up myself.
Must there no more be done?
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words
My brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good
My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
My custom always of the afternoon,
My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
My fate cries out,
My father's brother; but no more like my father
My father's spirit in arms! All is not well;
My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
My father, — methinks I see my father.
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
My good lord, —
My head should be struck off.
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
My honoured lord!
My hour is almost come,
My liege, and madam, — to expostulate
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
My lord, I cannot.
My lord, I did intend it.
My lord, I did;
My lord, I do not know;
My lord, I have news to tell you.
My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
My lord, I have remembrances of yours
My lord, I have.
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
My lord, I will be rul'd;
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
My lord, I'll hit him now.
My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,
My lord, from head to foot.
My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
My lord, not I.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
My lord, the king your father.
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
My lord, we were sent for.
My lord, we will not.
My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
My lord, you once did love me.
My lord?
My most dear lord!
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
My stern effects: then what I have to do
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
My tables, — meet it is I set it down,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites, — 
My too-much-changed son. — Go, some of you,
My virtue or my plague, be it either which, — 
My will, not all the world:
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
Nature is fine in love; and where 'tis fine,
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
Nay, I know not.
Nay, I know not: is it the king?
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Nay, but Ophelia —
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver, —
Nay, but swear't.
Nay, but to live
Nay, come again!
Nay, come, let's go together.
Nay, do not think I flatter;
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
Nay, good my lord, —
Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
Nay, let's follow him.
Nay, that follows not.
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is,
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
Nay, very pale.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be:
Neither, my lord.
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
Never believe it:
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;

No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
No more be done;
No more but so?
No more to undertake it, — I will work him
No more, sweet Hamlet.
No more.
No more.
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
No noble rite nor formal ostentation, — 
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my
No traveller returns, — puzzles the will,
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,

No, it is struck.
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;
No, let's come in.
No, my good lord.
No, my good lord; but, as you did command,

No, my lord; rather with choler.
No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the
No, no! the drink, the drink! — O my dear Hamlet! — 
No, nor mine now. My lord, you play'd once i' the university, you
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
No, not I;
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
No, nothing but ourselves.
No.
No.
No; you'll reveal it.
None but his enemies.
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Nor I, my lord.
Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor did you nothing hear?
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
Nor shall you do my ear that violence,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Nor thine on me!
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Not I, my lord.
Not a jot more, my lord.
Not a mouse stirring.
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in
Not from his mouth,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
Not shriving-time allow'd.
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
Not that I know.
Not that I think you did not love your father;
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Not when I saw't.
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
Nothing, neither way.
Nothing.
Now I am alone.
Now cracks a noble heart. — Good night, sweet prince,
Now fear I this will give it start again;
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Now wears his crown.
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
Now, mother, what's the matter?
Now, out of this, —

O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever

O heavenly powers, restore him!
O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
O heavy burden!
O heavy deed!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
O me, what hast thou done?
O most pernicious woman!
O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
O my prophetic soul!
O my son, what theme?
O royal knavery! an exact command, — 
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
O villany! — Ho! let the door be lock'd:
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! — But is there no
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
O'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord;

O, but she'll keep her word.
O, confound the rest!
O, farewell, honest soldier;
O, fear me not.
O, for two special reasons;
O, he is mad, Laertes.
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
O, ho! do you mark that? [To the King.]
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
O, my dear lord, —
O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns
O, say!
O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
O, speak to me no more;

Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
Of the unworthiest siege.
Of these dilated articles allow.
Of thinking too precisely on the event, — 
Of this his nephew's purpose, — to suppress
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Of those effects for which I did the murder, — 
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Of violent birth, but poor validity:
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice;
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
On plots and errors happen.
On such regards of safety and allowance
On wholesome life usurp immediately.
One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
One word more, good lady.
One.

Ophelia, Daughter to Polonius.
Ophelia, walk you here. — Gracious, so please you,
Ophelia,' — 
Or 'If we list to speak'; or 'There be, an if they might'; — 
Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
Or by some habit, that too much o'er-leavens
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio! — 
Or for some frontier?
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
Or like a creature native and indu'd
Or like a whale.
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight; — 
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
Or not at all.
Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
Or, — not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,

Our purpose may hold there.
Our son shall win.
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
Our wills and fates do so contrary run

Out of my weakness and my melancholy, —

Receives rebuke from Norway; and, in fine,
Remember it, my lord!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
Repast them with my blood.
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
Requite him for your father.
Resembles that it was. What it should be,

Season your admiration for awhile
See what a grace was seated on this brow;
See you now;
See, it stalks away!
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.
Servant.
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table, — 
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Shall in the general censure take corruption
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her,
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
She is importunate; indeed distract:
She married: — O, most wicked speed, to post
She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
She speaks much of her father; says she hears
She swoons to see them bleed.
She turns to favour and to prettiness.
She well instructs me.
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
Should have a back or second, that might hold
Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,
Since nature cannot choose his origin, — 
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
Since nor the exterior nor the inward man
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Sir, I cannot.
Sir, I lack advancement.
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,
Sir, a whole history.
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; — though, I
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
Sir, in this audience,
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
Sir?
Sit down awhile,
Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
Slanders, sir: for the satirical slave says here that old men
Sleep rock thy brain,
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
So be it!
So bloodily hast struck?
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
So far from cheer and from your former state.
So fast they follow: — your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
So he does indeed.
So horridly to shake our disposition
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
So levied as before, against the Polack:
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
So many journeys may the sun and moon
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
So much for this, sir: now let me see the other;
So much from the understanding of himself,
So nightly toils the subject of the land;
So oft it chances in particular men
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
So to seduce! — won to his shameful lust
So you must take your husbands. — Begin, murderer; pox, leave
So you shall;
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
So, by my former lecture and advice,
So, proceed you.
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
Soil our addition; and, indeed, it takes
Some little time: so by your companies
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Speak loudly for him. — 
Speak of it: — stay, and speak! — Stop it, Marcellus!
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
Speak to her, Hamlet.
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
Speak, man.
Speak;I am bound to hear.
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
Sprung from neglected love. — How now, Ophelia!
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me
Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
Stay, give me drink. — Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Stick fiery off indeed.
Still am I call'd; — unhand me, gentlemen; —
Still better, and worse.
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
Subscrib'd it: gave't the impression; plac'd it safely,
Such an act
Such as it is; — and for my own poor part,
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
Such was the very armour he had on
Sundays: — O, you must wear your rue with a difference. — There's a
Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
Swear by my sword.
Swear by my sword.
Swear.
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
Sweets to the sweet: farewell.
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
Take up the bodies. — Such a sight as this
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
Tell him that, by his license, Fortinbras
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.
Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Than I to Hercules: within a month;
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Than is my deed to my most painted word:
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
Than that which dearest father bears his son
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Than to entreaty.
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
Than your particular demands will touch it:
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Thanks, dear my lord.
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
That I essentially am not in madness,
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
That I have positively said ''Tis so,'
That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
That I might be the organ.
That I must be their scourge and minister.
That I must call't in question.
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
That are so fortified against our story,
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
That both the worlds, I give to negligence,
That can I;
That can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
That capability and godlike reason
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry, — 
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
That ever I was born to set it right! — 
That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound,
That flesh is heir to, — 'tis a consummation
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
That from her working all his visage wan'd;
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
That has no relish of salvation in't; — 
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, — 
That hath in it no profit but the name.
That hath made him mad.
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
That he is open to incontinency;
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
That he which hath your noble father slain
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer: — 
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
That is Laertes,
That is most certain.
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
That it might please you to give quiet pass
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
That live and feed upon your majesty.
That looks so many fadoms to the sea
That makes calamity of so long life;
That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
That might your nature, honour, and exception
That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,
That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
That our devices still are overthrown;
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
That she should lock herself from his resort,
That show of such an exercise may colour
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the
That so his sickness, age, and impotence
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
That they may seem the taints of liberty;
That thou so many princes at a shot
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
That thus he suffers for.
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like? — 
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
That to the use of actions fair and good
That treason can but peep to what it would,
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
That was and is the question of these wars.
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
That we find out the cause of this effect;
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
That you know aught of me: — this is not to do,
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
That your good beauties be the happy cause
That youth and observation copied there;
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That's two of his weapons: — but well.
That's very true, my lord.
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
That, if again this apparition come
That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
That, on the view and know of these contents,
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
The Devil himself.
The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
The King and Queen and all are coming down.
The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
The King my father!
The King rises.
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,
The Scripture says Adam digg'd: could he dig without arms? I'll
The actors are come hither, my lord.
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
The associates tend, and everything is bent
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
The bell then beating one, —
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
The better to beguile. This is for all, — 
The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
The canker galls the infants of the spring
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
The death I gave him. So again, good-night. — 
The devil take thy soul!
The doors are broke.
The drink, the drink! — I am poison'd.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
The effect of what I wrote?
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
The fair Ophelia! — Nymph, in thy orisons
The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind;
The form of plausive manners; — that these men, — 
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The glowworm shows the matin to be near,
The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
The head and source of all your son's distemper.
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
The imminent death of twenty thousand men
The important acting of your dread command?
The insolence of office, and the spurns
The instances that second marriage move
The inward service of the mind and soul
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The king is a thing, —
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
The king, sir —
The king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
The king, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses:
The lady protests too much, methinks.
The leperous distilment; whose effect
The light and careless livery that it wears
The lists, and full proportions are all made
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
The natural gates and alleys of the body;
The need we have to use you did provoke
The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
The observ'd of all observers, — quite, quite down!
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The origin and commencement of his grief
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
The platform.
The point envenom'd too! — 
The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
The queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow?
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit,
The rather if you could devise it so
The ratifiers and props of every word,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast, —
The safety and health of this whole state;
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
The sight is dismal;
The single and peculiar life is bound,
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
The soldiers' music and the rites of war
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian; you
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
The tedious day with sleep.
The terms of our estate may not endure
The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;
The time invites you; go, your servants tend.
The time is out of joint: — O cursed spite,
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
The triumph of his pledge.
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
The unseen good old man.
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
The very faculties of eyes and ears.
The very place puts toys of desperation,
The very same.
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
The violence of either grief or joy
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
The woman will be out. — Adieu, my lord:
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Their virtues else, — be they as pure as grace,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Then I would you were so honest a man.
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
Then came each actor on his ass, —
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
Then is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me
Then is the world one.
Then saw you not his face?
Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven;
Then up he rose and donn'd his clothes,
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
Then will I come to my mother by and by. — They fool me to the
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
Then, venom, to thy work.
Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension,
Thence to a watch; thence into a weakness;
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
There are the players.
There falling out at tennis': or perchance,
There is a play to-night before the king;
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
There is no shuffling; — there the action lies
There lives within the very flame of love
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
There was he gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
There with fantastic garlands did she come
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
There's fennel for you, and columbines: — there's rue for you;
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows, — 
There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
There's no offence, my lord.
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love,
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
There's tricks i' the world, and hems, and beats her heart;
There, my lord.
There, on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
Therefore I have entreated him along
Therefore let's follow.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
These hands are not more like.
These tedious old fools!
These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
They are coming to the play. I must be idle:
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
They are of Norway, sir.
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
They bleed on both sides. — How is it, my lord?
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
They had begun the play, — I sat me down;
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
They shall go far with little.
They were given me by Claudio: — he receiv'd them
Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
Think it no more:
This above all, — to thine own self be true;
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
This bodiless creation ecstasy
This business is well ended. — 
This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
This grave shall have a living monument:
This heavy-headed revel east and west
This is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
This is mere madness:
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
This is the very coinage of your brain:
This is the very ecstasy of love;
This is too heavy, let me see another.
This is too long.
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
This mad young man. But so much was our love
This man shall set me packing:
This marvel to you.
This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
This night to play before him.
This nothing's more than matter.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,
This present object made probation.
This quarry cries on havoc. — O proud death,
This something-settled matter in his heart;
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:
This sudden sending him away must seem
This to your majesty; this to the queen.
This unprevailing woe; and think of us
This warlike volley.
This was your husband. — Look you now what follows:
This world is not for aye; nor 'tis not strange
This, in obedience, hath my daughter show'd me;
This?
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: 'tis for
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger. — 
Thou know'st 'tis common, — all that lives must die,
Thou know'st already.
Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
Thou pray'st not well.
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind. — 
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
Thus much the business is: — we have here writ
Thus set it down: — he shall with speed to England
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
Thy natural magic and dire property
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
Till by some elder masters of known honour
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,
Till then in patience our proceeding be.
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
To England send him; or confine him where
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, — 
To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
To any pastime?
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
To be commanded.
To be contracted in one brow of woe;
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
To be, or not to be, — that is the question: — 
To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
To both your honours.
To business with the king, more than the scope
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
To cast thee up again! What may this mean,
To cut his throat i' the church.
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persevere
To do't. Examples, gross as earth, exhort me:
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
To ears of flesh and blood. — List, list, O, list! — 
To exploit, now ripe in my device,
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
To give it due content.
To give th' assay of arms against your majesty.
To give the world assurance of a man;
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
To give these mourning duties to your father;
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
To have prov'd most royally: and, for his passage,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
To hear and see the matter.
To hear him so inclin'd. — 
To hear of it: they are about the court,
To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home:
To heaven.
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
To hide the slain? — O, from this time forth,
To him from whom you brought them.
To his confine: and of the truth herein
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
To his own scandal.
To his unmaster'd importunity.
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
To keep itself from 'noyance; but much more
To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
To keep those many many bodies safe
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
To let this canker of our nature come
To let you know of it.
To make it truster of your own report
To make oppression bitter; or ere this
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
To mine own room again: making so bold,
To muddy death.
To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
To offer it the show of violence;
To our most valiant brother. So much for him, — 
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
To punish me with this, and this with me,
To put an antic disposition on, — 
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd
To reason most absurd; whose common theme
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
To show my duty in your coronation;
To show us so much gentry and good-will
To show yourself your father's son in deed
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
To sleep! perchance to dream: — ay, there's the rub;
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
To speak of horrors, — he comes before me.
To take him in the purging of his soul,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
To tell my story. —
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
To tell us this.
To the ambassadors of England gives
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
To the unsatisfied.
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd — 
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
To those of mine!
To try conclusions, in the basket creep
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
To what I shall unfold.
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
To what end, my lord?
To whom do you speak this?
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
To you alone.
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
To youth and liberty.
To't.
Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Together with that fair and warlike form
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd:
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Transports his poison'd shot, — may miss our name,
Treachery! seek it out.
Treason! treason!
Truly deliver.
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat
Two Clowns, Grave-diggers.
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven! — 
Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
Unto our climature and countrymen. — 
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
Up from my cabin,
Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Upon my honour, —
Upon my life, Lamond.
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
Upon my sword.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
Upon the talk of the poisoning? —
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Upon what ground?
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,
Upon whose property and most dear life
Very good, my lord.
Very like a whale.
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Very strangely, they say.
Very well, my lord.
Very well, my lord;
Very well. — Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.
Videlicet, a brothel, — or so forth. — 
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Volt.
Voltimand, Courtier.
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Was falsely borne in hand, — sends out arrests
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Was he a gentleman?
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
We both obey,
We cannot get from him.
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
We do, my lord.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
We go to gain a little patch of ground
We have sworn, my lord, already.
We heard it all. — My lord, do as you please;
We may of their encounter frankly judge;
We must with all our majesty and skill
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him,
We shall express our duty in his eye;
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel;
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
We shall, my lord.
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
We should profane the service of the dead
We think not so, my lord.
We will bestow ourselves. — [To Ophelia.] Read on this book;
We will haste us.
We will ourselves provide:
We will try it.
We will, my lord.
We will, we will.
We would not understand what was most fit;
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings, — 
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
We'll put the matter to the present push. — 
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
We'll wait upon you.
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
Welcome, Horatio: — Welcome, good Marcellus.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Welcome, my good friends!
Well be with you, gentlemen!
Well may it sort, that this portentous figure
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
Well, God-a-mercy.
Well, good night.
Well, my lord.
Well, my lord:
Well, sit we down,
Well, we shall sift him.
Well; — again.
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood, — 
What I have done
What I have said to you.
What are they that would speak with me?
What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,
What call you the carriages?
What ceremony else?
What ceremony else?
What company, at what expense; and finding,
What did you enact?
What do you call the play?
What do you think of me?
What does this mean, my lord?
What dost thou mean by this?
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
What follows, then, my lord?
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
What hour now?
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
What is between you? give me up the truth.
What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
What is he whose grief
What is it you will see?
What is the cause, Laertes,
What is the issue of the business there.
What is the matter, my lord?
What is the matter?
What is the reason that you use me thus?
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
What is't, my lord? we will.
What is, my lord?
What majesty should be, what duty is,
What man dost thou dig it for?
What means this, my lord?
What means your lordship?
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
What news, my lord?
What noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
What out of this, my lord?
What part is that, my lord?
What said he?
What shall I do?
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
What should we say, my lord?
What speech, my lord?
What think you on't?
What thou hast said to me.
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
What treasure had he, my lord?
What warlike noise is this?
What we two nights have seen.
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me? — 
What woman then?
What would she have?
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
What's his weapon?
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
What's that, my lord?
What's the matter now?
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? How are they
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
What, frighted with false fire!
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
What, ho, Horatio!
What, is Horatio there?
What, look'd he frowningly?
What, my lord?
What, the fair Ophelia?
What?
When I had seen this hot love on the wing, — 
When I to sulph'uous and tormenting flames
When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
When down her weedy trophies and herself
When he himself might his quietus make
When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
When honour's at the stake. How stand I, then,
When in one line two crafts directly meet. — 
When in your motion you are hot and dry, — 
When it prov'd otherwise?
When our deep plots do fail; and that should teach us
When second husband kisses me in bed.
When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
When thou liest howling.
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
When we would bring him on to some confession
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where are my Switzers? let them guard the door.
Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
Where is Polonius?
Where is my father?
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
Where is this king? — Sirs, stand you all without.
Where is this sight?
Where is your son?
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Where should we have our thanks?
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Where, my lord?
Wherefore should you do this?
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
Wherein they say you shine: your sum of parts
Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
Which I have told thee, of my father's death:
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of
Which have solicited. — the rest is silence.
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:
Which is not tomb enough and continent
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit
Which let thy wiseness fear: away thy hand!
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,
Which now goes too free-footed.
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes;
Which was the model of that Danish seal:
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
Whither wilt thou lead me? speak! I'll go no further.
Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Who commands them, sir?
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
Who hath reliev'd you?
Who is to be buried in't?
Who is't that can inform me?
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
Who shall stay you?
Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
Who's there?
Who, I?
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd, — 
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
Whose violent property fordoes itself,
Whose was it?
Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Why ask you this?
Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
Why does the drum come hither?
Why he more than another?
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Why should we, in our peevish opposition,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why the man dies. — I humbly thank you, sir.
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Why thou art thus incens'd. — Let him go, Gertrude: — 
Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
Why to a public count I might not go,
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
Why — 
Why — 
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Why, 'tis found so.
Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
Why, anything — but to the purpose. You were sent for; and
Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric;
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there;
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
Why, he had none.
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy,
Why, how now, Hamlet!
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
Why, look you there! look how it steals away!
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
Why, now you speak
Why, right; you are i' the right;
Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that he will
Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Why, then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk
Why, what a king is this!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
Why, what should be the fear?
Why?
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Will not debate the question of this straw:
Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
Will sate itself in a celestial bed
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
Will you be rul'd by me?
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a
Will you know them then?
Will you two help to hasten them?
Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
Will't please you go, my lord?
Winner and loser?
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
With a bare bodkin? who would these fardels bear,
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
With all my heart; and it doth much content me
With all my imperfections on my head:
With all my love I do commend me to you:
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
With an auspicious and one dropping eye,
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,
With drink, sir?
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
With most miraculous organ, I'll have these players
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought
With this affair along: — or all, our thanks.
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
With this regard, their currents turn awry,
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
With variable objects, shall expel
With what, i' the name of God?
With which she followed my poor father's body
With windlaces, and with assays of bias,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts, — 
With wondrous potency. Once more, good-night:
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, — 
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Within the centre.
Without debatement further, more or less,
Without more motive, into every brain
Without the sensible and true avouch
Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts:
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
Witness this army, of such mass and charge,
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
Words, words, words.
Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,
Woul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;
Would have mourn'd longer, — married with mine uncle,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
Would make them capable. — Do not look upon me;
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers — if the rest of my
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother. — 
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
Wronging it thus, — you'll tender me a fool.
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
Yea, from the table of my memory
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
Yes, faith, heartily.
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
Yet I,
Yet have I in me something dangerous,
Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
You are a good chorus, my lord.
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
You are merry, my lord.
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is, —
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all: — I am glad to see thee
You are welcome.
You cannot call it love; for at your age
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
You come most carefully upon your hour.
You do not understand yourself so clearly
You do remember all the circumstance?
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
You go not till I set you up a glass
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
You heavenly guards! — What would your gracious figure?
You know sometimes he walks for hours together
You know the wager?
You laying these slight sullies on my son
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours: for my part,
You mainly were stirr'd up.
You might have rhymed.
You mock me, sir.
You must not put another scandal on him,
You must not take for fire. From this time
You must sing 'Down a-down, an you call him a-down-a.' O,
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
You shall not go, my lord.
You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You will lose this wager, my lord.
You, as your business and desires shall point you, — 
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
Your grace has laid the odds o' the weaker side.
Your leave and favour to return to France;
Your loneliness. — We are oft to blame in this, — 
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
Your wisdom best shall think.
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
Yours, yours.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
